        Parameters:
            phone_number (``str``):
                Phone number in international format (includes the country prefix).

            phone_code_hash (``str``):
                Code identifier taken from the result of :meth:`~gramscript.Client.send_code`.

            phone_code (``str``):
                The valid confirmation code you received (either as Telegram message or as SMS in your phone number).

        Returns:
            :obj:`~gramscript.types.User` | :obj:`~gramscript.types.TermsOfService` | bool: On success, in case the
            authorization completed, the user is returned. In case the phone number needs to be registered first AND the
            terms of services accepted (with :meth:`~gramscript.Client.accept_terms_of_service`), an object containing
            them is returned. In case the phone number needs to be registered, but the terms of services don't need to
            be accepted, False is returned instead.

        Raises:
            BadRequest: In case the arguments are invalid.
            SessionPasswordNeeded: In case a password is needed to sign in.
