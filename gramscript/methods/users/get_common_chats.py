class GetCommonChats(Scaffold):

        Parameters:
            user_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.
                For your personal cloud (Saved Messages) you can simply use "me" or "self".
                For a contact that exists in your Telegram address book you can use his phone number (str).

        Returns:
            List of :obj:`~gramscript.types.Chat`: On success, a list of the common chats is returned.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If the user_id doesn't belong to a user.

        Example:

                print(common)
