        """Send photos.

        Parameters:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.
                For your personal cloud (Saved Messages) you can simply use "me" or "self".
                For a contact that exists in your Telegram address book you can use his phone number (str).

            photo (``str`` | ``BinaryIO``):
                Photo to send.
                Pass a file_id as string to send a photo that exists on the Telegram servers,
                pass an HTTP URL as a string for Telegram to get a photo from the Internet,
                pass a file path as string to upload a new photo that exists on your local machine, or
                pass a binary file-like object with its attribute ".name" set for in-memory uploads.

            file_ref (``str``, *optional*):
                A valid file reference obtained by a recently fetched media message.
                To be used in combination with a file id in case a file reference is needed.

            caption (``str``, *optional*):
                Photo caption, 0-1024 characters.

            parse_mode (``str``, *optional*):
                By default, texts are parsed using both Markdown and HTML styles.
                You can combine both syntaxes together.
                Pass "markdown" or "md" to enable Markdown-style parsing only.
                Pass "html" to enable HTML-style parsing only.
                Pass None to completely disable style parsing.

            ttl_seconds (``int``, *optional*):
                Self-Destruct Timer.
                If you set a timer, the photo will self-destruct in *ttl_seconds*
                seconds after it was viewed.

            disable_notification (``bool``, *optional*):
                Sends the message silently.
                Users will receive a notification with no sound.

            reply_to_message_id (``int``, *optional*):
                If the message is a reply, ID of the original message.

            schedule_date (``int``, *optional*):
                Date when the message will be automatically sent. Unix time.

            reply_markup (:obj:`~gramscript.types.InlineKeyboardMarkup` | :obj:`~gramscript.types.ReplyKeyboardMarkup` | :obj:`~gramscript.types.ReplyKeyboardRemove` | :obj:`~gramscript.types.ForceReply`, *optional*):
                Additional interface options. An object for an inline keyboard, custom reply keyboard,
                instructions to remove reply keyboard or to force a reply from the user.

            progress (``callable``, *optional*):
                Pass a callback function to view the file transmission progress.
                The function must take *(current, total)* as positional arguments (look at Other Parameters below for a
                detailed description) and will be called back each time a new file chunk has been successfully
                transmitted.

            progress_args (``tuple``, *optional*):
                Extra custom arguments for the progress callback function.
                You can pass anything you need to be available in the progress callback scope; for example, a Message
                object or a Client instance in order to edit the message with the updated progress status.

        Other Parameters:
            current (``int``):
                The amount of bytes transmitted so far.

            total (``int``):
                The total size of the file.

            *args (``tuple``, *optional*):
                Extra custom arguments as defined in the *progress_args* parameter.
                You can either keep *\*args* or add every single extra argument in your function signature.

        Returns:
            :obj:`~gramscript.types.Message` | ``None``: On success, the sent photo message is returned, otherwise, in
            case the upload is deliberately stopped with :meth:`~gramscript.Client.stop_transmission`, None is returned.

        Example:
            .. code-block:: python

                # Send photo by uploading from local file
                app.send_photo("me", "photo.jpg")

                app.send_photo("me", "https://i.imgur.com/BQBTP7d.png")
